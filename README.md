# pluralsight_meeting_planner

This is a small django project which is the result of the course 
[Django: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/django-getting-started/) from Pluralsight created by [Reindert-Jan Ekker](https://github.com/rjekker).

This project has been created using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and contains Dockerfile so it could be run in a container. It is not a part of the original course.
